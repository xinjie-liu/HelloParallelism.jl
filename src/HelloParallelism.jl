#=============== Tasks/Coroutines: (green) threads on a single core ===============#
"""
Green Threading: green threading with a task bound to channel for automatic
channel management.

The manager task bound to `result_channel` is used to keep channel alive until the
for loop is `@sync`ed again at the end.

If `spawn` is set to `true`, the manager task is launched in a separate thread.
This is a good idea if `some_work_that_takes_time` requires some heavy lifting (not
just `sleep`ing) since otherwise the main thread may be to busy to ever consume the
results.

    # channel is automatically closed when the Task finishes

#=================== Multithreading with shared-memory threads ====================#

"""
Multithreading 1: same as above but with `Threads.@threads` annotation on the
Channel task.

This yields shared-memory parallelism on a single machine. Note that the threads are already spawned by Julia at startup.
However, `Threads.@threads` spawn tasks on these exisitng threads.

As a result, this is much faster than spawning a new thread in, for example, C++ (because the creation of the thread is what takes time)

Warning: this does *not* reliably work if `spawn` is set to true since
`Threads.@threads` can only spawn new threads from `threadid()==1`

#=== Distributed across *process*, potentially live on another machine (node)====#

"""
The multi-process version of parallelisim for distribution across multiple
machines. This also has the advantage that memory is not shared.
Hence, this paradigm can be of benefit if we want to parallelize calls to non-thread-safe libs like PATHSolver.jl

This version uses a manager task that fetches the results from the workers
and `put!`s them on the `result_channel`.

Note: In order for this to work, you need to launch workers with; e.g. with
`start_workers` above.
